#### On inter-being and the joy of co-creation

When you land on a new website, it often feels like you're stepping into someone else's personal project. But this space is different. From the beginning, I realized it was never just mine. It was, and is, a co-creation.

My husband put in the technical work and built the page. My daughters shared their sense for design and beauty. Photographers contributed their vision through images. Students, friends, and supporters gave me encouragement and inspiration. And in everything I write, I carry the wisdom of my teachers, and the voices of those who walked this path long before me.

So yes, I coordinated — but I didn’t create alone. And now that you are here, reading these words, even you are part of it. Every sentence you read becomes part of your mind, your story, your journey. That is the real purpose of this website: to connect us, to inspire, and to invite you to join in practice and community.

Realizing this as co-creation changes everything. Life becomes lighter, because the weight of “me” becomes “we.” The ego loosens its grip. My success is not only mine, it is ours. My failures are not heavy burdens, because they are not mine alone. In truth, **we inter-are**.

And this is what I wish to share with you.
If you feel open to the joy of connecting, of co-creating in freedom of mind and body, then I warmly welcome you to join us — whether through reading, practicing, or simply being present.
