Since I practice silence, I attract the company of calm people. We rarely speak, and even then, we move mountains together, realizing shared projects. We spend creative, quality time together playfully, without masks. Sometimes we sit in silence next to each other, just being. Sometimes we don't see each other for months or years, yet when we reconnect, it's as if no time has passed, and we resume our connection without explanations, as if it were yesterday.  

As I practice silence, I talk less to my husband, but he speaks more. And it comes from the depths of his heart. I also give others more space in conversations, leading to greater harmony. I don't respond quickly to messages; words and spaces are filled with trust. It's not necessary to be in constant verbal communication to trust each other.

Since I practice silence, I exert less effort. If I have a problem, it resolves itself, or someone appears to help. I also arrive at the right place when I am needed. With less action, I perceive more. I feel my own needs and intentions and those of others better without getting lost in them. 

Since I practice silence, I sense the silence behind others' words. In music, every sound is born from silence and returns to it. Silence can be frightening, but also comforting. In true silence, space unfolds: everything is possible. You don't need to know the next step; the silence of the now embraces.

The stilling of the fluctuations of the mind is yoga - yoga chitta vritti nirodha. Yoga comes from and leads back to silence. Therefore, this will be enough; I return to silence. Shall we meet there?
